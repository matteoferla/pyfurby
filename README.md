# Furbexa

The victim, looking scared...

The idea and the majority of the setup came form [a blog post](https://howchoo.com/g/otewzwmwnzb/amazon-echo-furby-using-raspberry-pi-furlexa)
However, there were lots of problems and differences.
Namely

* the code here is IMO cleaner, along with extra functionality
* the components are squeezed in differently
* gyroscope

This project can be divided into:

* [hardware](hardware.md)
* [software](software.md)

On the software side, I was disappointed that Alexa not on an Echo cannot play music.
However, making it server a jupyter notebook and having a nice API (pyfurby) mean that it's rather fun.
In fact, I am going to find someone who can sew to make him a lab coat so he can give instructions at open days.
